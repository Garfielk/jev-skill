name: jev-route
description: Use to route a bounded task among available models, tools or specialists using explicit capability descriptions. Returns advice; does not switch a host primary model or install a router.

# Choose a tool, model or specialist

## Prerequisite and first example

Use the shared `jev-decide` CLI (Python 3.10+), installed from the reviewed
`jev-skill` package. If unavailable, explain the missing dependency rather than
silently installing software. The agent process must inherit
`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; never place the key in a prompt or request file.
No sibling skill or third-party integration is required for this judgment.
Actual UI, file, mailbox or simulation actions require the host's own tools.

Resolve `<skill-dir>` to this installed folder. Copy and edit
[assets/example.json](assets/example.json) for the user's task; it is synthetic
input, not a captured successful result. Validate it without a key or API call:

```bash
jev-decide decide <skill-dir>/assets/example.json --dry-run
# After reviewing the input and authorization to send it to OpenRouter:
jev-decide decide /path/to/edited-request.json
```

Normal calls send the supplied evidence to OpenRouter and its provider and incur
usage. Read relevant answers, not only the exit code: `0` means selected/scored,
`2` means review, `1` means error. A confidently false Noul is still false;
selection is not permission. Unknown, missing or conflicting evidence needs a
fallback. Test thresholds on the user's task rather than assuming 0.9 is safe.

## Workflow

1. Inventory actual available capabilities, allowed spending and task constraints. Do not infer access from a model name or prestige tier.
2. Describe each candidate by what it can and cannot do. Supply the current subtask and relevant preceding state, not an entire unrelated transcript.
3. Separate selection from invocation. Show a recommendation unless the user already authorized the handoff and the host has an invocation tool.
4. Preserve fallback routes for unavailable, uncertain or failed candidates. A recommendation does not authorize sharing data with another provider.
5. Evaluate routing regret and completed work along with total cost, cache loss and retries. This skill is not the upstream Codex Router service.

## Make it yours

Replace the example's evidence, candidate IDs and criteria together. Preserve a
no-match route when the real task can fall outside the labels. Agree on how the
host or person consumes each answer before enabling any automatic effect.
